The first plot shows a strong correlation between tuition fee status and academic success, where students with up-to-
date tuition fees are more likely to graduate, while those with unpaid fees tend to drop out. This indicates that
financial stability or prompt fee payment may significantly impact a student's likelihood of graduating. In the second
plot, gender appears to influence academic outcomes, with a higher proportion of female students graduating compared to
male students, who show a slightly higher dropout rate. This suggests that female students in this dataset may generally
 perform better academically or face fewer obstacles to graduation than their male counterparts.

Admission Grade vs. Other Attributes:

The distribution of admission grades shows a concentration between 100 and 140. However, there isn’t a clear correlation
between admission grade and other attributes like age at enrollment or grades in curricular units. This implies that a
student’s admission grade may not strongly influence their performance in later semesters.
Age at Enrollment vs. Other Attributes:

The age at enrollment has a significant range, with most students being around 17-25 years old. The scatter plot reveals
that age doesn’t appear to correlate strongly with performance in curricular units (grades in the 1st or 2nd semesters)
, suggesting that students’ ages don’t have a major impact on academic performance within the observed range.
Curricular Units 1st Sem (Grade) vs. 2nd Sem (Grade):

There is a visible positive correlation between the grades in the first and second semesters. Students who perform well
in the first semester tend to maintain similar grades in the second semester. This trend suggests a certain level of
academic consistency among students.
Grade Distributions in Curricular Units:

Both first and second-semester curricular units have a somewhat similar grade distribution, with clusters of students
achieving grades around 10-14. This might indicate a standard grading outcome or similar difficulty level across these
units.


Conclusions:
The lack of correlation between admission grades and subsequent performance might imply that initial academic
achievement (admission grade) isn’t necessarily a predictor of success in curricular units.

Age at enrollment doesn’t seem to influence student performance, at least within this dataset. There is consistency in
students’ performance from the first to the second semester, suggesting that those who do well initially tend to
continue doing well.

provides stable results without significant performance drops, making it the most reliable choice for this dataset.

Threshold = 0.5
Accuracy: 0.75
Precision:
Class 0: 0.67
Class 1: 0.81
Recall:
Class 0: 0.71
Class 1: 0.77
Threshold = 0.6
Accuracy: 0.6944
Precision:
Class 0: 0.57
Class 1: 0.87
Recall:
Class 0: 0.86
Class 1: 0.59

Analysis and Observation
At threshold = 0.5, the model has a balanced trade-off between precision and recall for both classes, especially Class 1
, which has a relatively high precision (0.81) and recall (0.77). This threshold provides a moderate balance, favoring
slightly higher recall for Class 0.

At threshold = 0.6, the model’s precision for Class 1 improves significantly to 0.87, while recall decreases to 0.59.
For Class 0, precision drops to 0.57, but recall increases to 0.86. This threshold shift indicates a higher confidence
in positive predictions (Class 1) but at the cost of missing more actual positives (lower recall for Class 1).

Conclusion
The 0.5 threshold offers a more balanced approach with reasonable accuracy and comparable precision and recall across
both classes. Threshold 0.6 shifts towards higher precision for Class 1 but lowers recall, making it suitable if the
goal is to reduce false positives for Class 1.
